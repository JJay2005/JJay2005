### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer and student in the UK. I am currently a Year 13 student at Herschel Grammar studying Computer Science, Physics and Maths.

I have experience in Python and Kotlin as well as SQL, Android App Development and Machine Learning.

Here are some projects that I've worked on:
